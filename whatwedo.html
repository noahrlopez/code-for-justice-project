        <h1>What We Do</h1>
        <h2 class="wwd-title">HOUSING AND SHELTER</h2>
        <p class="wwd-paragraph">Homes that are Safe, Secure, Clean, and Livable Safety: The first priority is a space that is safe for people. This means compliance with the fire and building codes that apply in any urban area. The space must resist external forces from wind, snow, earthquake, and live loads. The materials must be fire resistant. And the doors and windows must allow for safe way to leave the unit in an emergency. Security: The Urban Camp design is for personal control of access to home by user. While occupied, the space should be secure against unwanted entry. And while unoccupied it should serve as a secure storage for personal belongings. Urban Camp makes this work by including a separate utility area separate from the living space, so that maintenance can be performed without entry. Cleanliness: The design includes details for personal cleanliness: toilet, sink, and shower within personal space. This creates a sense of ownership for the user, and a motivation for regular cleaning. Water use within the unit is measured and controlled for very low consumption. This allows for off-grid use where a water feed to the site is not practical All-Weather: The design is for year round occupancy in both cold and hot weather. The unit is highly insulated to allow standard temperatures to be maintained with the minimal energy input. Heating and Cooling are hydronic to require only simple and safe systems at the living unit, with the equipment located remotely in the utility building. Small Footprint: The small foot print allows for just the basics: bath area, bed area, and pantry area. The 8 feet x 12 feet overall dimension allows homes to fit within a standard parking space.</p>
        <h2 class="wwd-title">COUNSELING</h2>
        <p class="wwd-paragraph">Mental Health Counseling is offered for: Depression Stress, Anxiety, Anger, Grief, and Mental Health. Legal Counseling will also be offered to those affected by public policy changes in Homeless affairs</p>
        <h2 class="wwd-title">REHABILITATION</h2>
        <p class="wwd-paragraph">Oftentimes, addiction is a result of homelessness. The difficult conditions of living on the street, having to find food, struggling with ill health, and being constantly away from loved ones create a highly stressful state of being. Individuals suffering from homelessness may additionally develop psychiatric conditions in response to a harsh lifestyle often characterized by feeling threatened by violence, starvation, and a lack of shelter and love. The Banin Org offers state of the art rehabilitation services for those affected by homelessness</p>
        <h2 class="wwd-title">EMPLOYMENT OPPORTUNITIES</h2>
        <p class="wwd-paragraph">The Ready To Work (RTW) program opens the doors of hope, transformation, and stability to formerly homeless and incarcerated men – rebuilding, restoring and revitalizing their lives. At Ready To Work we seek to address the core of the social, economic, or addiction issues that brought a participant to the program. With shelter, food, and basic safety issues being met, personal development and individual needs can be assessed, and our students can begin the restoration process. The extensive, one-on-one case management, life-skills programs, and paid employment from Ready To Work job crews, provide an unbroken pathway from homelessness to full-time employment, permanent housing, and careers. Breaking the cycles of their previous lives, participants begin restoring their self-worth and dignity, while securing the blessing of a hopeful future.
